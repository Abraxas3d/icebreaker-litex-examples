This is an example Risc-V SOC for the iCEBreaker FPGA.

The goal is to create a simple SOC that can be programmed from C, Rust or micropython.

== Structure ==

This repository is divided into several subdirectories.

* ./soc: Contains the litex build script to build the SOC.
* ./c-\*: Are C code examples.
* ./r-\*: Are Rust code examples.

== Getting Started ==

* Clone this repository onto your computer.
* Follow the instructions in the soc/README.md.
* Then follow the instructions in the soc/c-riscv-blink as this is meant to be
  the most basic and simple code example. After that feel free to explore all
  the other code examples.
